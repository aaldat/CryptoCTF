# CryptoCTF Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a set of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from the **Cryptography course** at **Politecnico di Torino**, part of the Master's Degree in Cybersecurity.

The challenges are divided into two main sections:

- **OpenSSL (C-based)**: focused on randomness, symmetric encryption, hashing, and big number operations using the OpenSSL library.
- **Python**: covering both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, including RSA attacks, HMAC forgery, padding oracles, mode guessing, and other practical exploits.

Each folder includes code, scripts, and input/output files used to solve the challenges. These exercises were completed in an academic context and are intended for **educational purposes only**.
